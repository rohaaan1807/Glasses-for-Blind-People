Components Required are: Arduino UNO , Ultrasonic Distance Measuring sensor, Buzzer, Battery 9 V, Charging Module, Jumper Wires.

Process -

Connect the Echo Pin and Trigger Pin to the Digital Pins (7 and 8) of Arduino UNO. 
Connect the Buzzer to Digital Pin 12 of Arduino UNO.
Now after defining these , set the trigger and buzzer pin as OUTPUT and echo pin as INPUT.
In the loop, set the respective distance for U S distance sensor(40 cm in this case) and the time of of buzzer respectively.
